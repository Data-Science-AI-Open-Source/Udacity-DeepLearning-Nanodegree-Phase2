Learning Plan
--
The first couple parts of this Nanodegree program covers the basics of deep learning and last 2 weeks. For the first 2 weeks of the program, you will build a strong background in how neural networks work, and this will act as the foundation for learning about more complex types of networks.

Week 1
-
This is a suggested first-week study plan, which is meant to help get you started at the right pace, as you begin. Below, you'll see the suggested timeline for completing the first several sections of the course.
Lesson: Welcome to Deep Learning
[The lesson you just finished!] In this lesson, we've introduced you to the program, as well as the support resources that are available to you.
Lesson: Applying Deep Learning
In this lesson, you'll see a variety of example applications for which deep learning is used.
Lesson: Anaconda
In this lesson, you'll learn all about the popular numerical package for python: Anaconda.
Lesson: Jupyter Notebooks
In this lesson, you'll develop some foundational skills for using Jupyter Notebooks; most of your work in the class will be using these!
Lesson: Matrix Math and NumPy Refresher
In this lesson, you'll get a short review on the basic linear algebra we’ll use in the course and some of the basics of NumPy.

Week 2
-
We hope you enjoyed your first week! This second week will be one of the faster paced weeks of the Nanodegree program. This week you’ll get into deep neural networks; you'll learn how to code a neural network of your own, and finish your first project!
Lesson: Introduction to Neural Networks
In this lesson, you'll get an introduction as to how neural networks work.
Lesson: Implementing Gradient Descent
In this lesson, you'll learn about implementing the optimization technique fundamental to deep learning: gradient descent.
Lesson: Training Neural Networks
In this lesson, you'll expand on the previous two lessons and learn how to train neural networks so that they can be used for regression or classification tasks.
Lesson: GPU Workspaces Demo
In this lesson, you'll get a short explainer on how to use Udacity workspaces, a cloud computing resource where you'll complete many of your projects.
Project: Predicting Bike Sharing Data
In your first project, you'll be predicting future bike ridership based on past data using a multi-layered, feedforward neural network.
