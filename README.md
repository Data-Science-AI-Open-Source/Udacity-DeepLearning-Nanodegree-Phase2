In this project, you'll build and train your own Nural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikesharing users on a given day.
Learning Plan
--
The first couple parts of this Nanodegree program covers the basics of deep learning and last 2 weeks. For the first 2 weeks of the program, you will build a strong background in how neural networks work, and this will act as the foundation for learning about more complex types of networks.
