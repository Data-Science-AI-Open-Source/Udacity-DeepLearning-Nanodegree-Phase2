Another great application of deep learning is in simulating traffic and making driving decisions. You can find the DeepTraffic simulator [here](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/). The network here is attempting to learn a driving strategy such that the car is moving as fast as possible using [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). The network is rewarded when the car chooses actions that result in it moving fast. It's this feedback that allows the network to find a strategy of actions for optimal speed.
To learn more about setting the parameters and training the network, read the [overview here](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/).
